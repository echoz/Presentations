## Details
The different Sessions for DevCon's Mobile Camp 3.0 at Bacolod. Also includes exported PDFs for easy downloads.

Includes Aviary Project Sample Code (Currently still WIP)

## Summary
The series of sessions were created on the pretense of getting people new to iOS but have a strong OOP background up and running with their first iOS app. It goes through some basic principles about Objective-C in comparison to other languages in the first half of the sessions. The other half focuses on what's needed to get from creating a new iOS project in Xcode to a working app.

It is by no means a complete comprehensive look into iOS, just a quite step 1 step 2 step 3 and so on guide to getting you up and running. More details as usual should be peruse from the excellent documentation on the Apple Developer site.

## Sample Project
Aviary is a clone of Birdhouse App for the iPhone but using modern iOS features like the Twitter Framework and ARC.
